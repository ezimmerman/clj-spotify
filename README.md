# Project
Calls a the spotify service https://api.spotify.com/v1/search  pulls the query from 
:query-params in ~/clj-spotify/resources/config.edn  and outputs the results to std out.

## Motivation
A simple clojure project that uses a spotify public API to try out:
- Stuart Sierra's component design.
- Http-Kit
- Core Async
- Immuconf for configuration.

With this kind of test run of those components, these components can be used to 
build much larger applications.

Easiest way to run things is to execute start-app function in main.clj
